homebrew-sdr
============

Homebrew formulas for software defined radio.

How do I install these formulas?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap abbrown1/homebrew-sdr` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If you only want to install a single formula without tapping or if the formula
conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install
abbrown1/sdr/<formula>`.


Third Party Taps
================

* Pothos [pothosware/homebrew-pothos](https://github.com/pothosware/homebrew-pothos)

  ```
  brew tap pothosware/pothos
  ```
